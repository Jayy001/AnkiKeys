## Features

- **Real-time Key Visualization**: Highlights keys as you press them, providing immediate pretty visual feedback 🤩
- **Shortcut Validation**: Automatically checks if your entered key combination matches the expected shortcut ✅
- ~~**Customizable Layout**: Choose from various keyboard layouts to suit your needs ♻️ ~~
- ~~**Note Agostnic**: Works with any Anki note type 🎫 ~~
- ~~**Reversible**: Memorise what the shortcut is for from the keys highlighted 🤔 ~~

## Usage - please read!

Once you've installed the extension, a new note type should be automatically created for you. Cards follow the format:

- Front: <What the shortcut is for>
- Back: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Del</kbd>

When adding the `Back` field, it's imperative you only enter the key combination and nothing else, as this is how the validation works.
Each key should be separated by a space. For example, if the shortcut was to select all text, you would enter `Ctrl A`.

During review, to answer the card, tap the <kbd>Escape</kbd> key. If you've made a mistake and want to correct it, simply tap the <kbd>Backspace</kbd> key as required.

In the case that the addon breaks and key presses are not recongised/being sent to Anki, please restart the program.

## Installation
Zip the contents of src/ to package.apkg and import it into Anki. Altenrativley, download a pre-built package from the releases page.
