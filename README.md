# Usage

Once you've installed the extension, a new note type should be automatically created for you. Cards follow the format:

- Front: [What the shortcut is for]
- Back: <kbd>Key1</kbd> <kbd>Key2</kbd> <kbd>Key3</kbd> <kbd>Key4</kbd>

When adding the `Back` field, it's imperative you only enter the key combination and nothing else, as this is how the validation works. (Unless you don't care about the validation, of course).

Each key should be separated by a space. For example, if the shortcut was to select all text, you would enter `Ctrl A`.

During review, to answer the card, tap the <kbd>Escape</kbd> key. If you've made a mistake and want to correct it, simply tap the <kbd>Backspace</kbd> key as required.

In the case that the addon breaks and key presses are not recongised/being sent to Anki, please restart the program.
